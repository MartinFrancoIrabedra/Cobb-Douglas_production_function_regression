# Cobb-Douglas_production_function_regression

Cobb- Douglas production function is definded as Y_i = A * K_i^α L_i^β where Y_i is a measure of output, K_i is the capital stock, and L_i is employment. A is the total factor productivity which is the ratio of aggregate output to aggregate inputs.
α is the output elasticity of capital and β is the output elasticity of labor.
A Cobb-Douglas production function is a mathematical tool that helps us understand how the quantity of goods produced depends on the resources or factors used in production. 
This formula is useful for figuring out the best combination of inputs to make production efficient and for estimating how technology affects the way we produce things.
The dataset used in this project contains data on output (value added) and inputs at the industry level for 459 industries in 1958 and 1993. 
The production function was transformed to a linear equation by taking logs and the parameters α and β by an OLS regression using total value added asa measure of output was estimated. Hypothesis test was also applied.
Later on, materials and energy were added as a factor of production.
